# Some basic principles 

## Why use relational database?

A relational database is a set of tables (datasets with rows and columns) that contain information relating to other tables in the database.

Relational databases have big benefits over simple data storage like CSV files or data frames, especially when it comes to keeping data neat and easy to handle. While CSV files can easily get messy with **repeated information**, relational databases organize data in tables that connect to each other, which helps avoid having the same data in more than one place. This setup makes it easier to change how data is organized without messing up the data itself or the programs that use it. 

Relational databases also let you do complex searches and changes with SQL, something that's hard with just CSV files or data frames. They provide a central place for data, making it easier for many people to use it at the same time while keeping the data safe and sound, showing why they're a go-to choice for managing detailed and interconnected data in a clean and efficient way.

## Connection to a database

"Connection to a database will depend on what sort of database we are working with and what programming language we are using. In this section, we will explore how to connect to both SQLite and MySQL databases using Python.

For a local SQLite database, Python's built-in `sqlite3` library provides a straightforward way to connect and interact with SQLite databases. SQLite is a file-based database, making it an excellent choice for lightweight applications, development, testing, or for situations where a simple yet reliable database is required without the overhead of a full database server.

```{python}
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database (the file)
conn = sqlite3.connect('movies.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()
```

For a local or remote MySQL server, the process involves using a third-party library like `pymysql`. MySQL is a more robust solution suitable for applications requiring concurrent access, advanced querying capabilities, and higher levels of data integrity and security. To connect to a MySQL database, you first need to ensure that the MySQL server is accessible and that you have the necessary credentials (username, password, database name, and server address).

```{python}
import pymysql

# Connection parameters
host = 'localhost'  # Or the IP of your MySQL server
user = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'
db = 'your_database_name'

# Establish a connection to the MySQL database
conn = pymysql.connect(host=host, user=user, password=password, db=db)

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()
```

After the connection is made, a query can be made using standardized syntax. 

```{python}
# SQL query to select names and directors from the movies table
query = "SELECT name, director FROM movies"

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch all the results
movies = cursor.fetchall()

# Print each movie's name and director
for movie in movies:
    print(f"Name: {movie[0]}, Director: {movie[1]}")

# Don't forget to commit (if you've made changes) and close the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

## Ordering of the verbs

When composing SQL queries, the sequence in which you arrange various clauses is crucial for the database to correctly execute commands and retrieve data. SQL syntax necessitates a specific order of operations, and following this hierarchy ensures your queries are both valid and efficient. Hereâ€™s an elaboration of the order of operations in an SQL query, emphasizing the hierarchy of SQL verbs and including examples for each:

1. SELECT: Specifies the columns to return. You can also perform calculations or transformations on the data here (e.g., SELECT name, SUM(sales) for aggregate sales by name).

1. FROM: Indicates the table(s) from which data will be retrieved (e.g., FROM sales_table). This clause sets the context for the source of your data.

1. JOIN: Used for combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them (e.g., JOIN product_table ON sales_table.product_id = product_table.id). The JOIN clause, which follows FROM, details the type of join (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER) and the conditions for joining.

1. WHERE: Filters rows based on specific conditions (e.g., WHERE sales_date > '2023-01-01'). Only rows that meet these criteria will be included in the output. This clause is applied before the data is grouped.

1. GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows (e.g., GROUP BY product_category). Essential for aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MAX, etc.), it organizes the data into subsets for aggregation.

1. HAVING: Filters groups of data after they have been aggregated with GROUP BY (e.g., HAVING SUM(sales) > 1000). WHERE filters individual rows, HAVING filters aggregated groups.

1. ORDER BY: Determines the order of the final set of rows returned, based on one or more columns (e.g., ORDER BY total_sales DESC). Specifies ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

1. LIMIT (or FETCH): Limits the number of rows returned by the query, useful for handling large datasets or implementing pagination (e.g., LIMIT 10 for the top 10 rows).

1. OFFSET: Skips a specified number of rows before starting to return rows from the query result (e.g., OFFSET 5 to skip the first 5 rows). Often used with LIMIT for paginated data retrieval.

An illustrative SQL query incorporating this order:

```{sql}
SELECT product_name, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_table
JOIN product_table ON sales_table.product_id = product_table.id
WHERE sales_date > '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY product_name
HAVING SUM(sales) > 1000
ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query is designed to identify the top 10 selling products based on total sales volume from January 1, 2023, onwards, filtering out any products that have not achieved more than 1000 in sales. The use of a JOIN operation ensures that the output includes the names of the products rather than just their IDs.
