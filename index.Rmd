I want this to be a personal repository of SQL codes that I write for my own future references. Unlike other online tutorials, I have taken some efforts to make sure this site is fully reproducible (with some basic `R` setups).

You could either read the individual articles or you could simply search for keywords.

The data that I have used for demo are available as CSV files.
